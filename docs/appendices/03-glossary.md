## üìÇ I. Types of Prompts

### 1. Prompt
- **Definition**: A specific input or instruction given to a language model to elicit a particular response.
- **Example**: "Translate the following English sentence to French: 'Hello, how are you?'"

### 2. Specialized Prompt
- **Definition**: A prompt crafted to obtain domain-specific or nuanced responses from the AI.
- **Example**: "Describe the process of photosynthesis in C4 plants."

### 3. Contextual Prompt
- **Definition**: A prompt that builds upon previous interactions or assumes prior knowledge from earlier in the conversation.
- **Example**: After discussing Shakespeare, "Which of his plays was set in Denmark?"

### 4. Templated Prompts
- **Definition**: Prompts that adhere to a standard structure, with specific parts (often dynamic variables) altering based on the situation.
- **Example**: "Translate the following ${language_1} sentence to ${language_2}: '${sentence}'"

## üìù II. Directives and Instructions

### 5. Initial Prompt Instructions (or Priming Instructions)
- **Definition**: The primary set of instructions given to the AI to establish context or behavior for subsequent interactions.
- **Example**: "You are an AI specializing in 19th-century literature."

### 6. Behavioral Directive
- **Definition**: Instructions within a prompt guiding the AI's behavior or tone.
- **Example**: "Please answer kindly."

### 7. Technical Directive
- **Definition**: Instructions emphasizing specific technical or domain-specific details the AI should heed.
- **Example**: "Focus mainly on ${dominant_rhyme_scheme} in your analysis."

## üîÑ III. Feedback and Adjustments

### 8. Feedback Loop
- **Definition**: A process where the AI's response is assessed, and feedback is provided, potentially refining the prompt or the AI's learning.
- **Example**: A user flags an AI-generated response containing inaccurate historical information.

## üõ† IV. Advanced Prompt Techniques

### 9. Prompt Engineering
- **Definition**: The art and science of devising effective prompts to obtain the desired output from a language model, considering its training, capabilities, and biases.

### 10. Dynamic Variables
- **Definition**: Elements within a prompt that adjust based on context, user input, or other factors.
- **Example**: "${sample_lyrics}" in a lyric analysis prompt.

### 11. Contextual Priming
- **Definition**: Using prior interactions or established context to subtly guide the AI's subsequent responses, without explicitly stating the desired output.
- **Example**: After a series of medical-related questions, the AI might be more attuned to answer a vague query in a medical context.

### 12. Iterative Refinement
- **Definition**: The process of progressively tweaking and refining a prompt based on the AI's responses to ensure accuracy and precision.
- **Example**: If the initial prompt "Tell me about water?" brings a too-general answer, it can be refined to "Explain the molecular structure of water."

### 13. Multi-Stage Prompts
- **Definition**: Prompts that are designed to take the AI through a sequence of thoughts or stages, leading to a more detailed or nuanced answer.
- **Example**: "Imagine you're explaining photosynthesis to a 5-year-old. Start with the basics and gradually delve into the cellular processes."

### 14. Conditional Prompting
- **Definition**: Crafting prompts that contain conditions, directing the AI to respond based on certain criteria being met.
- **Example**: "If the Eiffel Tower is in France, tell me about its history. If not, explain its location."

### 15. Prompt Stacking
- **Definition**: The technique of combining multiple prompts or questions into a single input to guide the AI's response in a specific direction or depth.
- **Example**: "Describe the process of photosynthesis. Focus specifically on how sunlight is used in the reaction and its importance to plant life."
