# Types of Prompts üìù

Welcome to the first chapter in our **Basics** section. Here, we'll delve into the various types of prompts you can craft for language models. Prompts play a pivotal role in directing and refining the responses of AI models. Understanding the different types and their uses can greatly enhance the outcome of your interactions.

## 1. **Direct Questions** ‚ùì
Direct questions are straightforward prompts that ask the AI a specific question.
* **Example:** `What is the capital of France?`

## 2. **Open-ended Prompts** üåÄ
These prompts are more abstract, allowing for a broader range of responses from the model.
* **Example:** `Write a story about a brave knight.`

## 3. **Instruction-based Prompts** ‚öôÔ∏è
Such prompts provide a command or a directive to the AI model, instructing it on what to do.
* **Example:** `Translate the following English sentence to French: "Hello, how are you?"`

## 4. **Fill-in-the-blanks** üï≥Ô∏è
Prompts that require the model to complete a sentence or paragraph.
* **Example:** `The Eiffel Tower is located in _______.`

## 5. **Contextual Prompts** üåç
These prompts provide a context or scenario for the AI to understand and then generate a relevant response.
* **Example:** `Imagine you're a historian in 2050, describe the significance of the internet in the 21st century.`

## Wrapping Up

Different scenarios require different types of prompts. By understanding the various categories and their use cases, you can optimize your interactions with AI models. Experiment with each type and see how subtle changes in the prompt structure can lead to varied outcomes.
