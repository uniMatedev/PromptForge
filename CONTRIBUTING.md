# Contributing to the Prompt Engineering Handbook 📚

We welcome and appreciate contributions to the Prompt Engineering Handbook! Whether you're fixing a typo, adding a section, or contributing an entire chapter, this guide will help ensure that contributions fit the style and structure of the handbook.

## 📖 Table of Contents

1. [Naming and Directory Structure](#naming-and-directory-structure)
2. [Markdown Guidelines](#markdown-guidelines)
3. [Pull Request Process](#pull-request-process)
4. [Maintaining Consistency](#maintaining-consistency)
5. [Review Process](#review-process)

## 📂 Naming and Directory Structure

- **Consistent Naming**: Use lowercase for file and directory names. Separate words with hyphens (e.g., `01-types-of-prompts.md`).
- All documents should be stored in the appropriate subdirectory within the `/docs` directory. For example, introductory content goes in `/docs/introduction/`.

## 📝 Markdown Guidelines

- Use `#` for main headings, `##` for sub-headings, `###` for sub-sub-headings, and so on.
- Keep lines to a maximum of 80 characters where possible for readability.
- Use emojis sparingly, mainly for visual emphasis or categorization.
- For linking between sections, use relative paths (e.g., `[Basics of Prompt Engineering](/docs/basics/01-types-of-prompts.md)`).

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a new **branch** for your update (e.g., `add-case-study-XYZ`).
4. Make your changes in this branch.
5. **Commit** and **push** your changes to your fork on GitHub.
6. Create a **Pull Request** in the main repository, detailing the changes you've made and why they're valuable.

## 🔍 Maintaining Consistency

- Stick to the established directory and file structure.
- Use the templates provided as a base for new content.
- Ensure your content doesn't duplicate existing content. Enhance or expand instead!

## 🧐 Review Process

- Once a Pull Request (PR) is made, members will review the content.
- Feedback may be given, and changes may be requested.
- Once the PR passes the review and adheres to the guidelines, it will be merged into the main branch.
